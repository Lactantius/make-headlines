#+title: Readme

Rewrite headlines from news organizations to change the positive/negative sentiment.

** Install/Deploy

1. Download [[https://nlp.informatik.hu-berlin.de/resources/models/sentiment-curated-distilbert/sentiment-en-mix-distillbert_4.pt][the very large sentiment model]], or some other model, to ~server/models/~. (It will otherwise download it automatically, but you will have to do that every time you build a docker image.)
2. Change the secrets in ~.env~
3. ~docker compose up~
4. ~docker exec sentimental-headlines-web-1 python3 -m server.seed~ (Will make this unnecessary soon.)
5. Served at localhost:5000. It must be changed in both ~gunicorn.config.py~ and ~docker-compose.yml~.

** TODO

- [ ] Flair pulls in dozens of dependencies, most of the unnecessary. Remove them from production, if possible
- [ ] Calculate semantic match
- [ ] Test frontend (Cypress?)
- [ ] Regularly re-run seed headlines function
- [ ] Let user see all rewrites
- [ ] Password reset
- [ ] User validations
- [ ] More news sources
- [ ] About page
- [ ] Default main page to only showing today's headlines
- [ ] Handle failed request to /api/rewrites gracefully on the frontend
